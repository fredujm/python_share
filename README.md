fbonnardot - My python tools to do signal processing
==

This module contains tools that I develop, adapt or translate to do signal processing with
Python.

Tools are organized into subfolders associated to themes (cyclostationarity, display, ...).

You can install these tools with pip :

	pip install fbonnardot

If you change or adapt a function, change its name (for example add your initial after the name)
