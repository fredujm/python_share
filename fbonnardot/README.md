# fbonnardot - My python tools to do signal processing


This module contains tools that I develop, adapt or translate to do signal processing with Python.

Tools are organized into subfolders associated to themes (cyclostationarity, display, ...).

You can install these tools with pip :

	pip install fbonnardot

*If you change or adapt a function, change its name (for example add your initial after the name)*

These tools were made for :
* personal work (http://frederic.bonnardot.free.fr),
* my research work at [LASPI](https://laspi.univ-st-etienne.fr),
* and for teaching at [IUT de ROANNE](https://iut-roanne.univ-st-etienne.fr).
